## 💡 Key Insights for AirPure Innovations

### 1. 🎯 Pollutant Targeting Strategy
- **PM2.5 & PM10** filters are mandatory across all regions.
- **CO Filters** for Karnataka (due to traffic emissions).
- **O₃ (Ozone) Filters** for Delhi & Gurugram (high photochemical smog).
- **Industrial Filters** for Byrnihat (Assam) — to target VOCs, SO₂, NO₂, and dust.
- **Allergen Filters** (pollen, pet dander, mold) recommended for all regions.

### 2. ⚙️ Essential Product Features
- **Smart Features**: WiFi, mobile app control, responsive touch panel.
- **Real-Time AQI Sensors**: Monitor PM2.5/PM10 and auto-adjust fan speed.
- **Low-Noise Operation**: Ideal for night use in bedrooms.
- **Child-Safe Design**: Secure panels, no sharp edges.
- **Strong After-Sales Support**: Filter replacement and service matters.
- **Affordable Pricing**: Especially for tier-2 cities without compromising on quality.

### 3. 📍 High-Demand Regions Identified
#### Tier 1 Cities:
- **Delhi NCR**
- **Bengaluru (Karnataka)**
- **Bahadurgarh (Haryana)**

#### Tier 2 Cities:
- **Patna & Hajipur (Bihar)**
- **Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh)**
- **Byrnihat (Assam)**

> Market trends show rising air purifier demand post-COVID due to health awareness, urbanization, and increasing pollution levels.

### 4. 🧪 R&D Alignment with Local Pollution
- Customize filter types by region (e.g. CO in Karnataka, O₃ in Delhi).
- Modular filter system for industrial areas (SO₂, VOCs, dust).
- Prioritize allergen and dust filtration in semi-rural zones.
- Focus on affordable, low-noise, child-safe designs for residential use.
